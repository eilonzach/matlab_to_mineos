%% Some ways this might go wrong for you:
% 1. Make sure all the paths are correct. The path to the Q model is
% hard-wired into the run_mineos and run_kernels code. I have provided this
% file on github, but unless your home directory is also "zeilon" then it
% certainly won't be in the folder these scripts expect it to be in. Go
% change its path in those two scripts. 
% 
% 2. You may not be able to plot the kernels without my plot_KERNELS
% function. That is also available from my github (repository:
% "eilonzach/seis_tools"). Or just plot them yourself and comment this line
% out...
% 
% 3. You don't have clone_figure - this is available through Mathworks
% fora, so google it. Again, you can just comment this line out and save
% the figures to retain them after others plot, if you want. 
% 
% 4. Probably others I've not thought of - if/when this fails, please let
% me know why (even if it's easy for you to fix).
